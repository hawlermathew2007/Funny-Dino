# About the Dino...

This project is made to give the user a cute little dino that walks around your computer screen and annoys you (in a cute and funny way). I was inspired by Desktop Goose made by Samperson and amazed by the cute sprites made by Arks. Henceforth..., this CUTE FUNNY DINO in Desktop is born! XD

**Instruction:**
- cd to the directory that contains the funny.py files
- run "python funny.py" to execute the Dino
- To close it, you can use key Shift + 6 or execute the close_dino file by running "python close_dino.py"
