# About the Dino...

This project is made to give the user a cute little dino that walks around your computer screen and annoys you (in a cute and funny way). I was inspired by Desktop Goose made by Samperson and amazed by the cute sprites made by Arks. Henceforth..., this CUTE FUNNY DINO in Desktop is born! XD

**Instruction:**
- You need to download Python first. Link: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Open Command Prompt and cd to the directory that contains the funny.py files
```dif
> C:\Your\Current\Path> cd "Funny Dino"
```
- Run "python funny.py" to execute the Dino
```dif
> C:\Your\Current\Path\Funny Dino> python funny.py
```
- To close it, you can use the key Shift + 6 or Open another Command Prompt to execute the close_dino file by running "python close_dino.py"
```dif
> C:\Your\Current\Path\Funny Dino> python close_dino.py
```
